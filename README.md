# Youtube_API

## Getting Started

I initially created this project in Google Colab; however, if you prefer to use Jupyter Notebook, please follow the steps below:

### Prerequesites

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library (install using `pip install pandas` if not already installed)

#### Installation

1. Clone this Github repository:
  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AfonsoPaula/Youtube_API.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Youtube_API
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the **'Youtube_API.ipynb'** notebook to see the code in action.

## Usage

In this notebook, you will find step-by-step explanations and code examples for:
1. Learning how to use the **'requests'** library to make API calls.
2. Making API calls to the Youtube Data API.
3. Collecting data as JSON.
4. Saving the data as a pandas DataFrame.
5. Refactoring the code with good Software Engeneering (SWE) fundamentals.
